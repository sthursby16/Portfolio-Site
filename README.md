This is my portfolio site that includes previews of several of my coding projects that I'm most proud of. 

These include: a CSS stylesheet with some colors, fonts, and font sizes that are appealing to me; a site for a fictional chess club; and a site for a fictional 
cafe.

I created the portfolio site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
